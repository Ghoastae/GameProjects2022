Hello my name is aidan and this is my entry to why I wanna go to tech camp so lets begin,I always liked the idea of computers and science as a kid
Mostly because of the nintendo games my mom bought me and while playing these magical games in my garage I thought if I could make these types 
of games when I grow up,But I didnt know nor ask my parents about coding or computer science so I never really thought about it
it was only until I got into 5th or 6th grade that It really dawned on me because at that time people talking about college and shiz and I knew
damn well I had to choose something for my career path,so I told my mom hey I wanna do computer science you mind if you can get me a book to help me
and she did just that,she bought this book off amazon called python for kids,downloading python for me was kinda hard,maybe because I never really 
Used computers at that time but whatever,I never knew at that moment I would enter a industry I would love
