Hello my name is aidan and this is my entry to why I wanna go to tech camp so lets begin,I always liked the idea of computers and science as a kid
Mostly because of the nintendo games my mom bought me and while playing these magical games in my garage I thought if I could make these types 
of games when I grow up,But I didnt know nor ask my parents about coding or computer science so I never really thought about it
it was only until I got into 5th or 6th grade that It really dawned on me because at that time people talking about college and shiz and I knew
damn well I had to choose something for my career path,so I told my mom hey I wanna do computer science you mind if you can get me a book to help me
and she did just that,she bought this book off amazon called python for kids,downloading python for me was kinda hard,maybe because I never really 
Used computers at that time but whatever,I never knew at that moment I would enter a industry I would love,also another reason I would like to go 
to this camp is just also to get a head start in the industry and improve my skills because right now In my life Im focused on my career choices
right now and just in general meet new people and make new experiences for myself,and another reason I would like to join this camp because
after going to the TECH ed camp I went to last year I wanted to go to another one just to relive those good memories and to meet new people and also 
to learn more about my skills and passion,because Rn in my life people are talking about their career choices and school and college and I honestly
wanna learn fast and improve my skills an I think joining this tech ed camp will help me do that,To be honest Im not much interested in biology
but more interested in computer science/coding So I will take that route,as biology has never been my thing even when I was a kid,computer science on
the other hand always interested me and I would search up tutorials looking how to improve,like youtube tutorials,books,etc etc
